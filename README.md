## Lessons Learned

OOP in Javascript is very difficult and functional code would have been much more efficient given the small size of the application. However, putting into practice OOP priniciples for the first time was an interesting challenge!



## Known Bugs

When a successful 'snap' has been made, the deck of cards returned to the winning player no longer have event triggers attached to them so they are no longer in play.
