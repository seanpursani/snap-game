## Lessons Learned

OOP in Javascript is very difficult and functional code would have been much more efficient given the small size of the application. However, putting into practice OOP priniciples for the first time was an interesting challenge!



## Known Bugs

- In the process of fixing the scoring system
- The main function of 'snapping' is not working at present!

An ongoing project...
